├── 3.12.x: Extended support until December 2024
└── 4.x:    Active development and long-term support

⚠️ Risk: No security patches, bug fixes, or vendor support after EOL
💰 Impact: Compliance violations, security vulnerabilities
```

#### **Security Vulnerabilities**
```
🔒 Security Concerns in 3.x:
├── CVE-2023-46118: Management plugin XSS vulnerability
├── CVE-2023-46119: HTTP API authentication bypass

└── No future security patches for 3.x versions

✅ 4.x Security Enhancements:
├── Enhanced authentication mechanisms
├── Improved TLS/SSL implementation
├── Better input validation and sanitization
└── Active security monitoring and patching
```

#### **Performance Degradation**
```
📊 Performance Limitations in 3.x:
