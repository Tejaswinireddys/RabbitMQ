## 🔧 Environment Configuration Examples

### Sample Environment File (environments/prod.env)
```bash
# Production Environment Configuration
ENVIRONMENT_NAME="prod"
ENVIRONMENT_TYPE="production"
RABBITMQ_CLUSTER_NAME="rabbitmq-prod-cluster"

# Node Configuration
RABBITMQ_NODE_1_HOSTNAME="prod-rmq-node1"
RABBITMQ_NODE_2_HOSTNAME="prod-rmq-node2"
RABBITMQ_NODE_3_HOSTNAME="prod-rmq-node3"

# IP Addresses
RABBITMQ_NODE_1_IP="10.20.20.10"
RABBITMQ_NODE_2_IP="10.20.20.11"
RABBITMQ_NODE_3_IP="10.20.20.12"

# VIP Configuration
RABBITMQ_VIP="10.20.20.100"

# Environment-specific settings
RABBITMQ_VM_MEMORY_HIGH_WATERMARK="0.7"
RABBITMQ_DISK_FREE_LIMIT="5GB"
EMAIL_ALERTS="prod-oncall@company.com"
```

### Generated Configuration Files
The system automatically generates environment-aware:
- `rabbitmq.conf` - With environment-specific cluster name and nodes
- `advanced.config` - With environment-specific Erlang settings
- `definitions.json` - With environment-specific users and policies
- `rabbitmq-server.service` - With environment variables

## 📊 Environment Operations Dashboard

Access the comprehensive operations dashboard:
```bash
./environment-operations.sh operations-menu prod
```

Dashboard Features:
- 📊 Real-time environment status
- 🔍 Comprehensive health checks
- 📈 Monitoring and alerting
- 🔄 Rolling restart management
- ⚙️ Configuration management
- 💾 Backup and restore
- 🧪 Testing and validation

## 🔒 Security Features

### Environment-Specific SSL/TLS
```bash
# SSL certificates organized by environment
/etc/rabbitmq/ssl/
├── qa/
│   ├── ca_certificate.pem
│   ├── server_certificate.pem
│   └── server_key.pem
├── staging/
└── prod/
```

### Environment-Specific Users
Each environment has its own:
- Admin user: `admin` (from `RABBITMQ_DEFAULT_USER`)
- Custom users: `teja` and `aswini` (from `RABBITMQ_CUSTOM_USER_*`)
- Environment-specific passwords

## 📈 Monitoring and Alerting

### Environment-Aware Monitoring
```bash
# Monitor specific environment
./monitor-environment.sh -e prod -m daemon -a

# Output formats supported
./monitor-environment.sh -e prod -f json        # JSON output
./monitor-environment.sh -e prod -f prometheus  # Prometheus metrics
```

### Integrated Alerting
- Email notifications per environment
- Slack integration with environment context
- Prometheus metrics with environment labels
- PagerDuty integration for production

## 🔄 Rolling Operations

### Environment-Aware Rolling Restart
```bash
# Rolling restart with environment validation
./rolling-restart-environment.sh -e prod

# Force restart without prompts
./rolling-restart-environment.sh -e prod -f

# Custom wait times
./rolling-restart-environment.sh -e prod -w 60
```

Features:
- Pre-restart validation
- Environment-specific backup creation
- Node health validation
- Cluster quorum monitoring
- Post-restart validation

## 🛠 Deployment Workflow

### New Environment Setup
1. **Create Environment**: `./environment-manager.sh create new-env`
2. **Configure Settings**: Edit `environments/new-env.env`
3. **Validate Config**: `./load-environment.sh validate new-env`
4. **Generate Configs**: `./generate-configs.sh new-env`
5. **Deploy Configs**: `./environment-manager.sh deploy new-env`
6. **Setup Cluster**: Run `cluster-setup-environment.sh` on each node
7. **Validate Health**: `./environment-operations.sh health-check new-env`

### Existing Environment Updates
1. **Backup Current**: `./environment-manager.sh backup env-name`
2. **Update Config**: Edit environment file
3. **Validate Changes**: `./load-environment.sh validate env-name`
4. **Generate New Configs**: `./generate-configs.sh env-name`
5. **Rolling Update**: `./rolling-restart-environment.sh -e env-name`

## 📋 Migration from Old System

### For Existing Deployments
1. **Backup Current Setup**: Create backup of existing configurations
2. **Create Environment**: Map current setup to environment file
3. **Validate Mapping**: Ensure all settings are captured
4. **Test in QA**: Deploy to QA environment first
5. **Rolling Migration**: Use rolling restart to migrate production

### Configuration Mapping
```bash
# Old static configuration
cluster_formation.classic_config.nodes.1 = rabbit@node1

# New environment-aware configuration  
cluster_formation.classic_config.nodes.1 = rabbit@${RABBITMQ_NODE_1_HOSTNAME}
```

## 🎊 Summary
