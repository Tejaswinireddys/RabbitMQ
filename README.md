## 🚀 Quick Start

### For New Deployments:
1. Review [deployment documentation](docs/deployment/)
2. Configure environment settings in `environments/`
3. Run installation scripts from `scripts/installation/`
4. Apply configurations from `configs/templates/`

### For Existing Clusters:
1. Check [monitoring guides](docs/monitoring/)
2. Review [upgrade procedures](docs/upgrades/)
3. Use management scripts from `scripts/management/`

### For AI/ML Implementation:
1. Follow [AI implementation guide](docs/ai-ml/)
2. Set up predictive analytics and auto-scaling
3. Configure intelligent monitoring and self-healing
